### Flake8 - Python 

- To ensure the Python code follows PEP 8, the project was linted using flake8.
- .flake8 file was added in the project root:
- exclude = venv, .venv, env, migrations, __pycache__, manage.py.
- Run flake8 . in the terminal and everyting is clean.
  
  ### What was fixed with flake8
  
- removing trailing whitespace
- fixing extra/too many blank lines
- adding the required 2 blank lines before top-level defs/classes
- splitting overly long lines
- removing unused imports
  
# chore(init): initialize project structure
# docs(readme): add project documentation and setup guide
